/*
Project Description: This project explores Gulf Coast Regional Medicare Hospital Spending aggregated by claim type, 
					 during index hospital admission, for the calendar year 2021. Utilizing MySQL Server tools, 
                     in this project we take the forementioned data and transform it to make it more usable for analysis.

Skills Used: This project highlights oneâ€™s ability to perform table joins, table alterations, create temporary tables,
			 as well a creating stored functions using MySQL syntax. 
                     
Data Source: The data used for this MySQL project was the 
			 Medicare Hospital Spending by Claim
             obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
             
Data Source/Dictionary Link: https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/nrth-mfg3/
