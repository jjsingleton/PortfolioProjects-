/*
Project Description: This project explores raw data reports specific to opioid related drug overdoses and deaths amongst human begins 
					 located in the United States of America between the years of January 2019 through December 2021. Utilizing MySQL 
                     Server tools, in this project we take the forementioned data and transform it to make it more usable for analysis.

Skills Used: This project highlights oneâ€™s ability to clean data, create views, create stored procedures with input parameters, 
			 Year-Over-Year analysis, and the utilization of window/ fetching (LAG) and aggregate functions. 

Data Source: The data used for this MySQL project was the 
			 VSRR Provisional Drug Overdose Death Counts 
             obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention
